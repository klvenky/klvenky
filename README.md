This is Venkatesh, a Web Developer by day. I primarily work on node.js and a little bit of react. I love to solve problems,mostly the ones which become numbers at the end.

In one such attempts to problems, I have come across the [N-Queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). I have tried hard to solve it on board first, programatically later and officially went mad :exploding_head:. Also, whiteboard was getting hard to erase & add queens. So, I have created a way to visualize it and solve it. You can find it in my github profile.

_Not interested in code?_ How about playing the [game](https://n-queens-helper.netlify.com/).

I wanted to learn a new language(programming as well as a spoken one). I have started this with python quite sometime back. I chose [euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for the programming part. However,later decided to solve them with [golang](https://golang.org/). No hatred for Python, just thought of exploring go. I've started with the journey of solving the euler-archives in Golang. It's was budding & still is ðŸ˜…, but you can check it out [here](https://github.com/klvenky/euler-archives-go).

I have tried to contribute to OSS, without any success. Not yet there I guess, probably :sweat_smile:. I would love to look in if there's a decent repo which I can deep dive into. Let me know of any such chances.

Cheers :beers:
