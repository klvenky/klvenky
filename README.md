I am Venkatesh. A Web Developer working at [Convertcart](https://www.convertcart.com), a CRO(Conversion Rate Optimization) startup in Bengaluru, India. We try to build industry-scale CRO applications which help in a better conversion for Your E-commerce. 

I primarily work on node.js and a little bit of react.


I have created a way to visualize the classic [N-Queens problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_queens_puzzle). You can find it in my github profile. Not interested in code? How about playing [here](https://n-queens-helper.netlify.com/).


I try to solve problems mostly. I have been trying to learn a new programming language to improve my skills. I have choosen to use [euler archives](https://projecteuler.net/archives) for this. I have started this with python([repo](https://github.com/klvenky/euler-archives-python)) quite sometime back, however, I have decided to go with [golang](https://golang.org/) now as it's well suited for web dev as well. Repo is [here](https://github.com/klvenky/euler-archives-go).

Wish me all the best :)
